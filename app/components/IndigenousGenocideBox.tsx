                Since the start of Israel’s escalated 
                genocide against the Palestinian people in October 2023, Israel has decimated the campus of every university of the Gaza Strip: Al-Aqsa University, Al-Azhar University, Islamic University of Gaza, Al-Quds Open University, University of Palestine, Al-Israa University, University College of Applied Sciences, University of Gaza, Palestine College of Nursing, Palestine Technical College, Arab College of Applied Sciences.

                This destruction is an escalation of a longstanding Israeli practice. Since their founding, Palestinian university campuses have been obstructed, raided, and bombarded by Israel. This has been conceptualized by Karma Nabulsi as “scholasticide,” Israel’s intentional destruction of Palestinian centers of education.

                <em>Indigenous truthtelling</em> seeks to disrupt this destruction by the Israeli state, and to feature the writings, art, and analysis of Palestinian knowledge carriers.
